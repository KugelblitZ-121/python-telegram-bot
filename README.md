  Start the bot and choose /newbot to create you API_KEY that you  will use in the python script. <br>
  You will have many options to control your baby bot like /setdescription /setabouttext etc. It's so easy and straight forward.<br>
  You can find your bot by typing @Your_bot_username in the search bar

- Step 2: 
  Download the code I provided in this repository and put your own BOT_NAME and API_KEY <br>
  On your terminal, run: <br>
  ```pip3 install python-telegram-bot``` <br>
  Lastly: run the code starting from line 63 (if __name__ == '__main__':)

- Step 3 (optional)
  Go to www.pythonanywhere.com and upload your code as a new file to make it run forever for FREE (So that you can close your machine and sleep in peace)

#Notes

- You can add the bot to a group chat and make it an admin to automate replying to people
- If you're using VScode, you might get a warning saying 'Import "telegram.ext" could not be resolvedPylancereportMissingImports'. In that case, make sure to use pip3 install,
- If you're still getting that warning, try to run the code and if it works you can just ignore the warnings. Such warning doesn't appear on Pycharm.
- If you're having problems with running pip3 install python-telegram-bot, try running conda install python-telegram-bot instead.
